;; The following is a formula for the volume of a cone using it's height and the radius of its bottom face as parameters (Question 2a)

(define (volume radius height)
  (*(/ 1 3) pi(expt radius 2) height))

;;Question 2b, the formula finds the escape speed from large mass (Mass_bod) with a certain radius (planet)

(define (escape Mass_bod radius)
  (sqrt (/ (* 2 6.674e-11 Mass_bod) radius)))

;;Question 2c

;; (personal note) for the exponent, there are two values, the base and the exponent
(define(Stirling n)
  (*(sqrt (* 2 pi n))
    (expt (/ n e) n)))

;;Question 2d, calculates the monthly payment on a credit card
(define (payment principal rate num_payments)

;;Question 2e, Partition size approximation for any number n

;;NOTE TO SELF:  EXP IS EXPONENTIAL (uses e) expt is exponent
